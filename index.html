  <h1>Hi, I'm <s>Pomu</s>Kizu</h1>
  <h2>...expected anything else from someone who started learning stuff the painful way?</h2>
  I learned-ish how to use the internet (more) when I was 11. Wasn't a big mouth back then; only talked about stupid stuff when I first used Discord. <b>(I WASN'T UNDERAGE WHEN I FIRST USED IT TRUST ME)</b><br>
   <br>
  Now I'm 14, and I'm kinda happy at the road i ended up to. I never thought I'd be actually into programming because i always said to myself "It's gonna be hard and would just waste your time". So i learned some more and I ended up learning my first language: HTML (and pre-Python).<br>
  <br>
  Several months later and I would start studying more code; around this time I got introduced into my second language: CSS (...sort of).<br>
  <br>
  A few months more into digging the wild world of the Internet and i found another interest: VTubers<br>
  <br>
  A bit hard to explain on how i got into them but pretend that you never saw this text and just think of "Oh, this guy fell into the rabbit hole!" (Like, seriously.)<br>
  <br>
  <h1>Useless Information That You Might Like</h1>
  DNI: transphobics, racists, weird people (be friendly to everyone PLEASE.)<br>
  <br>
  Would love to talk about: Programming (if YOU teach me some stuff :3), VTubers (not deeply into them currently but I'll try to "just go with it"), Tech stuff, Linux, Software, Open-source, Minecraft, Terraria, Tetris, Sonic the Hedgehog, Undertale/DELTARUNE, Environment, Music, üêâüî•, Philippines/Filipino stuff, Memes (with humor i can understand), Anything about computers, AI, community management.
